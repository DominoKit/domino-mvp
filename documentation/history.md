# History
In Domino-mvp history is all about tracking changes and updating the URL token and use that to do routing, in a presenter we obtain a new history instance by calling the method `history()` or in any other class in the application by calling `ClientApp.make().history()`.

More information about how to deal with history can be found in the [Domino-history repository](https://github.com/DominoKit/domino-history)
